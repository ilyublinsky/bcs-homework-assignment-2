                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                      <br>
                  <p>
                      I was born in Brooklyn, and NY lived between New York and New Jersey for most of my childhood. 
                      In late high school I decided to move to Florida with my family to be near my grandparents, and decide to go to school for acting. 
                      While I was going to school in South Florida, I randomly started to learn and enjoy playing poker with my friends, and wanted to make a career out of it. 
                      For about two years of my life, I was an amatuer poker player, and made enough money to transfer to the university of my choice. 
                      I ended up moving to Chicago and getting my Bachelors in Acting at University of Illinois at Chicago. 
                      I ended up lovign Chicago and living there through most of my young adult years.
